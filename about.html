						<p>Initiating my entrepreneurial journey as an International Educationist, I had many dreams and a vision clear in my mind, of not failing and getting a PR. But then the phase that I had to go through before being a successful entrepreneur, how could I forget that? 
                        <br> And there's where I got the motivation to aid international students to get easy settling in the Canadian atmosphere. And now, when it's over five years of voluntarily helping and spreading awareness amidst the International Students, Institutes, and other Immigrants, and working in close contact with them to help them have a successful transition to Canadian Society, I feel that incubating my company to aid students achieve their dreams would be an icing on top of the cake!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Hey, I'm Sidhanshu Sharma, and I too came to Canada, along with my whole gang of dreams as an international student. I had no clue how life would turn out to be. I didn't know how I was going to make it to a country that I wasn't familiar with, and neither I had sources who could guide me enough. But, when I got my PR, I will never forget what I asked an official, 'Does that mean we don't have to go back?!' That hit me bull's eye. I just knew that all the tears and frustrations that came with the process of uprooting myself during the study period and going out of my comfort zone were all worth it.
                        <br> So, now being well settled here in Canada, I'm switching to helping students in achieving their dreams because I think it's an area where I can continue to change lives and be an asset for the upcoming generations. Now, I have a vision and a mission that what I had to face shouldn't be confronted by any International Immigrant coming to Canada with eyes full of dreams and a heart full of hopes.</p>

                            The track of choosing various career options from an engineer to a lecturer, from a certified associate in project management to an education services manager. But what made understood with time is that no matter which sector you are working in, education is always indispensable', Education isn't about learning only, but it also leads to 'continuous improvement, resulting in adroitness in a changing environment. And thus, I believe I finally landed up as an Education Facilitator.
                            <br> Now that, after Being  settled well in Canadian provinces,  that the hardships I have gone through could be learning to others. So, by being a part of Seven Seas Education Services, would like to explore  this opportunity to help students to the fullest.

                            Hey, I'm Puneet Setia, and as usual, my arrival in Canada as an international student was no easy.  I, too, had to confront many hardships such as cultural shock, homesickness, and too much confusion about how to make new friends. Undoubtedly, I struggled with the different and modern model of education being followed by Canadian students, which emphasized the continuous involvement of students for their successful completion of credentials. But now, when I have well settled myself in Canada and amid its people, I feel my student life could have been less challenging if I had got the right guidance and directives when I landed in Canada with a bag full of dreams, but with no clue what would I be doing. Now that I have settled well in Canadian provinces, I feel that the hardships I have gone through could be learning to others. I would encourage folks to take free advice even if they wish to apply on their own or through any other educational agents so that we can still make a significant impact in the community. They can leverage the services provided by our company in a very fruitful way.
